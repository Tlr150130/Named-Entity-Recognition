## Usefulness
The filtering of text for named entities are useful for determining document similarity with high value words. So, this process for named entity filtering will be the basis for many other document and noun relationship algorithms.

## Improvements
By itself, the filtering for named entities yields limited useful results. The process can be extended through the incorporation of other algorithms such as TF-IDF and named entity relationships. Furthermore, the incorporation of some words such as adverbs and adjectives may yield better docment comparisons.
